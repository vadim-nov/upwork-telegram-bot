Laravel Spark has the subscription management and payment functions I need, so you shouldn&#039;t need to customize anything on those. If you do not already have a license for Spark, please make that clear, I will buy it and transfer it to you, but that will be accounted for in comparing bids. For the subscription management, the author subscribes and chooses how many students they will have and then picks the plan they pay for. After the author creates their first book, they get a link to give to their students. The students register and can view the book at no cost.<br /><br />

1. FOREX signals (Please refer to www.fxprofitsignals.io &amp;amp; www.pipsalert.com)<br />
2. Digital marketing services (Please refer to www.odigits.io)<br />
Both are subscription based with 3 different packages: USD60, USD120 and USD240 per month. <br /><br />
Below link is what the client has in mind in terms of look and organization, but recommended we find another equal and better looking template with a business look still: <br />
https://themeforest.net/item/financial-services-hub-business-corporate-html-theme/17867047 <br />
There should be Monthly option and annual option for subscription. The annual subscription will save 10% versus monthly.<br />
The option of the USD240 will include subscription for both services the Digital Marketing and getting the FOREX signals.<br /><br />
Create a structure for affiliation marketing program for the above two business streams &amp;quot;FOREX signals&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Digital Marketing services&amp;quot;:<br />
Meaning a customer can recommend another customer and if the other customer joins and pays, then the original customer gets 50% of the subscription for the first time only, then if the customer continues, he gets 30% instead of 50% and every month he gets 30%. Once the second customer invites in a new customer, he himself will get 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;and then 30%, but the person above him gets 30% of the person below the one below him.<br />
In other words, each person will be rewarded for 2 layers of customers under him.<br /><br />
For the Digital Marketing services, when the customer choose one of the packages 60$ or 120$ or 240$ he will then be taken to a screen where he will have a drop menu of the 5 Digital Marketing services and he can choose 2 services for the 60$ or 4 services for the 120$ or Full list of services for the 240$. The list will contain: Local SEO, Email marketing, social media marketing, Pay Per Click, YouTube advertising, Search Engine Optimization Please refer to services tab on https://www.odigits.io.<br /><br />
Create a calculator to see how much you earn. Please refer to calculator under www.odigits.io.<br /><br />
www.gourl.io is the website we can source bitcoin payment gateway as per the client needs.<br /><br />
We need to show like currency FOREX table on the landing page.<br />
Also customers if they sign in, in their zone, they should see a tree diagram of who is under them (in terms of affiliates) as this is how they will be paid on a monthly basis. They should see also who is active or not active.<br /><br />
The marketing affiliation program should show 2 levels of subscribers only with their photos. (Please refer to the word attached document) <br /><br />
Client is expecting 10,000 subscribers to his program and it is a global targeting.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $400

For candidates who can work on CET +1 from 8 am to 6 am!<br /><br />
In this role, you will be working researching new and innovative technology for products before creating prototypes and the associated documentation to be able to pass over to us for implementation. <br /><br />
A curious and detail-oriented mindset is vital as you will need to keep up to speed with current and future technologies and best practices. In addition to this, the ability to work quickly and effectively in frequently fast-changing situations is crucial.<br /><br />
The ideal candidate for this role has experience working as a PHP Developer with modern PHP frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Symfony or Lumen) and databases (e.g. MySQL), as well as with API&rsquo;s.<br /><br />
**Responsibilities**<br /><br />
- Undertaking continuous research and analysis of new trends and techniques to ensure that we are able to use the latest developments in order to continue to grow<br /><br />
- Developing small-scale prototypes and proofs of concept, which may later be scaled-up to full-scale solutions<br /><br />
- Creating documentation for these prototypes to provide a seamless handover to the development teams<br /><br />
**Hiring Process**<br />
Interesting candidates will be asked to prove their abilities and level in a task.<br /><br />
